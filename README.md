# SnowBoarder
This is my second project in Unity, a 2D snowboarding game. 
Players control a snowboarder as they navigate through various slopes and performing jumps. The game features basic movement mechanics. Built using Unity and C#, this project is designed to practice 2D game mechanics and physics.
